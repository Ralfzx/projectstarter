# projectstarter
this is my projectstarter wich is overcomplicated!
#What does it do?
Its simple one command line command and you have a folder for your project and optionaly opens vscode for you!
#SETUP
clone this repo in some folder!
open new cmd windows as ADMINISTRATOR or else setup wont work
navigate to your folder where you cloned this repo using `cd <path to folder>`
write `python setup.py`
paste path to folder where you store your projects
if you want to open vscode after creating project type `True` else `Fasle`
Now you can use it by using command `create <project name>`
